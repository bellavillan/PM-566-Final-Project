The opioid crisis, declared a national health emergency in 2023, has been a public health issue since the late 1990s, when misleading assurances about the addictive nature of prescription opioids led to widespread over-prescribing. Over time, this crisis unfolded in three distinct waves: the initial rise in prescription opioid-related deaths (1999-2010), a surge in heroin use and overdose deaths after restrictions on prescription opioids (2010-2013), and the rapid increase in deaths from synthetic opioids like fentanyl, which are far more potent and lethal (2013-present).
