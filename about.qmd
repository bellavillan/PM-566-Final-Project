## Background
Declared a national health emergency in 2023, the opioid crisis has been a public health issue since the late 1990s, when misleading assurances about the addictive nature of prescription opioids led to widespread over-prescribing. Over time, this crisis unfolded in three distinct waves: the initial rise in prescription opioid-related deaths (1999-2010), a surge in heroin use and overdose deaths after restrictions on prescription opioids (2010-2013), and the rapid increase in deaths from synthetic opioids like fentanyl, which are far more potent and lethal (2013-present).

## Selected Dataset

The dataset, ‘Drug Overdose Death Rates by Drug Type, Sex, Age, Race, and Hispanic Origin in the United States (1999-2016),’ was obtained from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Drug-Poisoning-Mortality-by-State-United-Stat/xbxb-epbu/about_data). It includes 2,862 observations across 19 variables, such as crude and age-adjusted death rates, demographic factors, and state-level data. This dataset serves as the foundation for the analysis presented on this site.

## Questions of Interest:

1. Over time (1999-2016) and in consideration of all ages and all origins, which regions of the United States have had the greatest increase of drug poisoning death rates?

2. Throughout the United States, is there a strong association with Hispanic origin and drug mortality?

3. How do drug poisoning death rates compare between men and women nationally from 1999-2016?

4. Which age ranges see the most drug poisoning deaths?
