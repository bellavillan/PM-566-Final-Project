    "text": "Description\nWelcome to my data science portfolio, where I apply statistical and analytical skills to uncover critical insights into one of the most pressing public health crises in recent U.S. history. Using a comprehensive dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on drug overdose death rates (1999–2016), this project explores key questions about how drug mortality has evolved over time, the demographic factors at play, and regional disparities in the epidemic.\nThrough interactive visualizations and in-depth analysis, you’ll discover:\n1. Which regions of the U.S. have seen the sharpest increases in drug poisoning death rates over time.\n2. Whether Hispanic origin is strongly associated with drug mortality across the nation.\n3. How drug poisoning death rates differ between men and women in various U.S. regions.\nThis project not only demonstrates the power of data in addressing real-world challenges but also serves as a foundation for my growing expertise in public health analytics. Dive deeper into the insights on the full project page!\nView the Full Analysis in My Written Report\n\n\nInteractive Data Visualizations\nThe plots display the mean drug poisoning death rates across different U.S. regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West) from 1999 to 2016, with each region represented by a distinct color. The national death rate is shown as a red line to highlight the overall trend alongside regional variations."

    "text": "Methods\nThis public access dataset was created by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in December 2017, and available on the CDC Data website. Among the NCHS content on this database, a plethora of drug poisoning mortality datasets and visualization tools are available to assess the opioid crisis under different lenses. For this dataset, multiple variables of interest were included like sex, age, race and Hispanic origin, and region. This made this specific dataset the most attractive because of its amount of information available.\n\nUnderstanding the NA Values\nIn cleaning the dataset, checking for NA values is an important step. Using the function: colSums(is.na(drug_mortality)), there is an equal amount of NA values across the variables named Age-adjusted Rate, Standard Error for Age-adjusted Rate, Lower Confidence Limit for Age-adjusted Rate, Upper Confidence Limit for Age-adjusted Rate. The age-adjusted rates are missing for many entries, and the decision to filter them out or use an alternative rate (like crude rates) must be made.\nThis equal amount of 1728 NA values is due to how age-adjusted rates cannot be calculated without the known weight of each age group within a population each year. When assessing the dataset, the NA values only occur when matched with the national data (State variable value = “United States”) as well as the Age Group variable is an age range rather than “All Ages”. Because all of the NA values are related to the age-adjusted rates, this is not an issue for using the data. Deleting the data with NA values would be a mistake as it augments our understanding of the true data, and imputing the data to be the mode or mean of similar characteristics is not possible because it would not be accurate to what the variables measure.\nCrude death rates will be used instead when considering specific age ranges and when considering the national data, the variable “US Crude Rates” will be used.\n\n\nRemoving Irrelevant Variables\nNext in cleaning the data, I opted to remove two columns (variables) because they were not relevant to the data being analyzed. The variable “Unit” and “State Crude Rate in Range” will not be necessary in this project because of our intended research question and scope of our data analysis. The original dataset’s Unit variable had two values of “Deaths per 100,000 resident population, age-adjusted” or “Deaths per 100,000 resident population, crude”. The “Unit” variable does not fill any gaps of information that another variable cannot inform, and removing this variable is not a loss in the greater scope of the data. The State Crude Rate in Range is not relevant to the question of interest as we are considering regions in the United States instead of individual states as well as the comparison to the US Crude Rate, the State Crude Rate in Range variable is also repetitive and contains excess information.\nAfter cleaning the data and using the function: str(drug_mortality[sapply(drug_mortality, is.character)]), 6 variables were loaded in as chr (character or text) variables: State, Sex, Age Group, Race and Hispanic Origin State Crude Rate in Range, and Unit have been removed Using the function: str(drug_mortality[sapply(drug_mortality, is.double)]), 13 variables were loaded in as dbl (double or numeric with decimal) variables: Year, Deaths, Population, Crude Death Rate, Standard Error for Crude Rate, Lower Confidence Limit for Crude Rate, Upper Confidence Limit for Crude Rate, Age-adjusted Rate, Standard Error for Age-adjusted Rate, Lower Confidence Limit for Age-adjusted Rate, Upper Confidence Limit for Age-adjusted Rate, US Crude Rate, and US Age-adjusted Rate\nSeeing that the Sex, Race and Hispanic Origin, and Age Group variables are character or text variables and have repeat values, I decided to create these variables as factors where repeated values are then organized into categories (i.e. Sex has “Both Sexes”, “Female”, and “Male”). This will make calling on these variables in the future easier, like in the instance of drug mortality rates being compared between the male and female sexes. Using the function: str(drug_mortality) , I was able to authenticate the conversion of variables to categorical variables where the variables values were listed by each unique value (i.e. Sex should only have 3 values if done correctly).\nIn the case of the variable “Race and Hispanic Origin” (RHO), values like All Races - All Origins, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, and Hispanic were all present in this column. To combat the excess of wordings to get information about this variable, I opted to create a new categorical variable (new column) named Hispanic and assign values whether the individual is of Hispanic origin or not. When the RHO column indicated only the word “Hispanic” the value would be 1, while the value would be 0 if the RHO column indicated “Non-Hispanic” along with their race, or if it indicated “All Races - All Origins”.\n\n\nRepresentative States for US Regions\nOur research question of interest asks what regions have had the greatest increase in drug poisoning mortality, I also opted to divide all 50 states (and the District of Columbia) into their respective US regions according the how the CDC defines the geographic regions in the United States. The previous use of the representative 5 states for the US regions is helpful to guide our hypotheses on which regions are expected to have higher drug poisoning mortality rates, but to get a more specific visualization of the data, use of all 50 states (and additional territory of the nation’s capital, Washington D.C.) is necessary.\nIn the State variable, “United States” is also included as a value which indicates that data of those rows are national data, which points to the US Crude Rates. This will be useful when comparing the regions to the national rates."

    "text": "Conclusion (include graphs)\nFour graphs were created to visualize the numerical data of the average drug poisoning mortality rates in each US region and compare these rates to the national average. When considering the research question of interest, the US region that has the greatest increase in drug poisoning mortality in comparison to all US four regions and the national average was the Northeast region, clearly visualized by the second line plot graphing “Average Drug Poisoning Death Rate by US Region (1999-2016)”.\nThe initial graph, showing the representative 5 states of each US region, allows the observers to gain an initial impression of the data. With this line graph “Average Drug Poisoning Death Rate by Representative State”, we notice that Illinois (representing the Midwest) and New York (representing the Northeast) have the steepest slopes in this initial line graph, indicating that these two regions may have the higher mortality rates than the other regions. When allowing more specificity by dividing all 50 states and the District of Columbia into the four US regions, we can properly assess the mortality rates of each region and can conclude that the Northeast region has had the greatest increase in mortality rates, as indicated by the steep slope of its line (large increase over smaller period of time) as well as the magnitude of the mean death rate value (nearing 40 deaths per 100,000 at the peak in the year 2016). When ranking the steepness of linear slopes of each region, the South has the second steepest slope, then the National mortality rate, then the Midwest, and finally the West. The West region is ranked last in this ranking, though in the graph it has the third highest mortality rate of about 17 deaths per 100,000 persons, its slope plateaus around the year 2011-2012, and steadily rises as seen in the faceted line plot.\nThe box plot presents similar information in a different format, where the Northeast, South, and Midwest have similar distributions with some higher outliers, but the West consistently shows lower mortality rates, visualized in lowest amount of outliers (even its outliers are lower than the other 4 categories) as well as a seemingly normal distribution in its box plot. The Midwest, like the line plots, has the lowest mortality rates but drastically increases over time. The national distribution has the largest spread and the highest overall outliers, reflecting the extreme cases across the U.S.\n\nPotential Factors Behind Observed Trends\nPublic health responses to the declaration of a national health emergency have affected populations, yet some regions of the United States may have more ease of accessing health care arising from policy like increased regulation of opioid prescriptions, efforts to expand access to treatment for opioid use disorder, and the distribution of naloxone — a life-saving medication that can reverse opioid overdoses. This may explain the plateau of the West region’s drug poisoning mortality rates, while Northeast and South rates continued to skyrocket – as these regions are politically more diverse and unlikely to resolve policy easily. Despite these efforts, drug poisoning deaths have continued to rise in the last decade, exacerbated by the increasing presence of synthetic opioids like fentanyl noted as the “third wave” of the opioid epidemic.\nThe opioid crisis undoubtedly disproportionately affects certain demographics, with higher rates among middle-aged adults, non-Hispanic whites, and men. It would be worth exploring the correlation rates between these demographics, such as sex, Hispanic origin, and age, with the newfound knowledge gained from this data analysis of US regions and death mortality rates."

With this line graph “Average Drug Poisoning Death Rate by Representative State”, we notice that Illinois (representing the Midwest) and New York (representing the Northeast) have the steepest slopes in this initial line graph, indicating that these two regions may have the higher mortality rates than the other regions. When allowing more specificity by dividing all 50 states and the District of Columbia into the four US regions, we can properly assess the mortality rates of each region and can conclude that the Northeast region has had the greatest increase in mortality rates, as indicated by the steep slope of its line (large increase over smaller period of time) as well as the magnitude of the mean death rate value (nearing 40 deaths per 100,000 at the peak in the year 2016). When ranking the steepness of linear slopes of each region, the South has the second steepest slope, then the National mortality rate, then the Midwest, and finally the West. The West region is ranked last in this ranking, though in the graph it has the third highest mortality rate of about 17 deaths per 100,000 persons, its slope plateaus around the year 2011-2012, and steadily rises as seen in the faceted line plot.\nThe box plot presents similar information in a different format, where the Northeast, South, and Midwest have similar distributions with some higher outliers, but the West consistently shows lower mortality rates, visualized in lowest amount of outliers (even its outliers are lower than the other 4 categories) as well as a seemingly normal distribution in its box plot. The Midwest, like the line plots, has the lowest mortality rates but drastically increases over time. The national distribution has the largest spread and the highest overall outliers, reflecting the extreme cases across the U.S.\n\nPotential Factors Behind Observed Trends\nPublic health responses to the declaration of a national health emergency have affected populations, yet some regions of the United States may have more ease of accessing health care arising from policy like increased regulation of opioid prescriptions, efforts to expand access to treatment for opioid use disorder, and the distribution of naloxone — a life-saving medication that can reverse opioid overdoses. This may explain the plateau of the West region’s drug poisoning mortality rates, while Northeast and South rates continued to skyrocket – as these regions are politically more diverse and unlikely to resolve policy easily. Despite these efforts, drug poisoning deaths have continued to rise in the last decade, exacerbated by the increasing presence of synthetic opioids like fentanyl noted as the “third wave” of the opioid epidemic.\nThe opioid crisis undoubtedly disproportionately affects certain demographics, with higher rates among middle-aged adults, non-Hispanic whites, and men. It would be worth exploring the correlation rates between these demographics, such as sex, Hispanic origin, and age, with the newfound knowledge gained from this data analysis of US regions and death mortality rates."

    "section": "Methods",
    "text": "Methods\n\nHow and Where the Data Were Acquired\nThis public dataset was created by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in December 2017, and is available on the CDC Data website. Among the NCHS content on this database, a plethora of drug poisoning mortality datasets and visualization tools are available to assess the opioid crisis under different lenses. For this dataset, multiple variables of interest were included like sex, age, race and Hispanic origin, and region. This made this specific dataset the most attractive because of its amount of information available. This dataset was exported from the CDC website as a CSV file, which was then loaded below.\n\n\nLoading the Dataset\n\nlibrary(readr)\ndrug_mortality &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Downloads/NCHS_-_Drug_Poisoning_Mortality_by_State__United_States_20241018.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\n\nCleaning the Data\n\nUnderstanding the NA Values\nIn cleaning the dataset, checking for NA values is an important step. Using the function: colSums(is.na(drug_mortality)), there is an equal amount of NA values (1728) across the variables named:\n\n“Age-adjusted Rate”,\n“Standard Error for Age-adjusted Rate”,\n“Lower Confidence Limit for Age-adjusted Rate”, and\n“Upper Confidence Limit for Age-adjusted Rate”.\n\nThe age-adjusted rates are missing for many entries, and the decision to filter them out or use an alternative rate (like crude rates) must be made.\nWhen assessing the dataset, the NA values only occur when matched with the national data (State variable value = “United States”) as well as the Age Group variable is an age range rather than “All Ages”. This equal amount of NA values is due to how age-adjusted rates cannot be calculated without the known weight of each age group within a population each year.\nBecause all of the NA values are related to the age-adjusted rates, this is not an issue for using the data. Deleting the data with NA values would be a mistake as it augments our understanding of the true data, and imputing the data to be the mode or mean of similar characteristics is not possible because it would not be accurate to what the variables measure.\nCrude death rates will be used instead when considering specific age ranges and when considering the national data, the variable “US Crude Rate” will be used.\n\n\nRemoving Irrelevant Variables\nNext in cleaning the data, I opted to remove two columns (variables) because they were not relevant to the data being analyzed. The variables “Unit” and “State Crude Rate in Range” will not be necessary in this project because of our intended research question and scope of our data analysis. The original dataset’s Unit variable had two values of “Deaths per 100,000 resident population, age-adjusted” or “Deaths per 100,000 resident population, crude”. The “Unit” variable does not fill any gaps of information that another variable cannot inform, and removing this variable is not a loss in the greater scope of the data. The State Crude Rate in Range is not relevant to the question of interest as we are considering regions in the United States instead of individual states as well as the comparison to the US Crude Rate, the State Crude Rate in Range variable is also repetitive and contains excess information.\n\nsuppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(dplyr)))\ndrug_mortality &lt;- drug_mortality |&gt;\n  select(-c(\"Unit\", \"State Crude Rate in Range\")) # Removal of irrelevant columns to focus on important data\n\n\n\n\nWrangling the Data\nAfter cleaning the data and using the function: str(drug_mortality[sapply(drug_mortality, is.character)]), 6 variables were loaded in as chr (character or text) variables:\n\nState, Sex, Age Group, Race and Hispanic Origin.\nVariables: State Crude Rate in Range and Unit have been removed\n\nUsing the function: str(drug_mortality[sapply(drug_mortality, is.double)]), 13 variables were loaded in as dbl (double or numeric with decimal) variables:\n\nYear, Deaths, Population, Crude Death Rate, Standard Error for Crude Rate, Lower Confidence Limit for Crude Rate, Upper Confidence Limit for Crude Rate, Age-adjusted Rate, Standard Error for Age-adjusted Rate, Lower Confidence Limit for Age-adjusted Rate, Upper Confidence Limit for Age-adjusted Rate, US Crude Rate, and US Age-adjusted Rate\n\nSeeing that the Sex, Race and Hispanic Origin, and Age Group variables are character or text variables and have repeat values, I decided to create these variables as factors where repeated values are then organized into categories (i.e. Sex has “Both Sexes”, “Female”, and “Male”). This will make calling on these variables in the future easier, like in the instance of drug mortality rates being compared between the male and female sexes.\nUsing the function: str(drug_mortality) , I was able to authenticate the conversion of variables to categorical variables where the variables’ values were listed by each unique value (i.e. Sex should only have 3 values if the conversion was successful).\n\ndrug_mortality$Sex &lt;- as.factor(drug_mortality$Sex)\ndrug_mortality$`Race and Hispanic Origin` &lt;- as.factor(drug_mortality$`Race and Hispanic Origin`)\ndrug_mortality$`Age Group` &lt;- as.factor(drug_mortality$`Age Group`)\n\n\nCreating a “Hispanic” Categorical Variable\nIn the case of the variable “Race and Hispanic Origin” (RHO), values like All Races - All Origins, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, and Hispanic were all present in this column. To address the excess wording need to understand this variable, I used the package dplyr as a tool for data exploration and opted to create a new categorical variable (new column) named “Hispanic”. In this new variable, I assigned values whether the individual is of Hispanic origin or not. When the RHO column indicated only the word “Hispanic” the value would be 1, while the value would be 0 if the RHO column indicated “Non-Hispanic” along with their race, or if it indicated “All Races - All Origins”.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\ndrug_mortality &lt;- drug_mortality %&gt;%\n  mutate(Hispanic = ifelse(grepl(\"Non-Hispanic\", `Race and Hispanic Origin`), 0,\n                           ifelse(grepl(\"Hispanic\", `Race and Hispanic Origin`), 1, NA))) # NA values account for the \"All Races - All Origins\" values in the `Race and Hispanic Origin` variable.\n\n\n\nRepresentative States for US Regions\nBecause all 50 states would be too much information to assess in order to form a conclusion, I have chosen 5 states to represent the regions of the United States. The United States is often divided into four main regions: Northeast, Midwest, South, West and Central. I added Colorado as a representation for the Central region to account for the vastness of the United States.\n\nNortheast: New York\nMidwest: Illinois\nSouth: Texas\nWest: California\nCentral: Colorado\n\nThis condenses the original data set of 2862 observations down to 90 observations, which should be easier to handle in preliminary data analysis.\n\nselected_states &lt;- c(\"New York\", \"Illinois\", \"Texas\", \"California\", \"Colorado\")\n\nfiltered_drug_mortality &lt;- drug_mortality %&gt;%\n  filter(State %in% selected_states)\n\nAdditionally, since our research question of interest asks what regions have had the greatest increase in drug poisoning mortality, I also opted to divide all 50 states (and the District of Columbia) into their respective US regions of Northeast, South, Midwest, and West according to how the CDC defines the geographic regions in the United States.\nThe previous use of the representative 5 states for the US regions is helpful to guide our hypotheses on which regions are expected to have higher drug poisoning mortality rates, but to get a more specific visualization of the data, use of all 50 states (and including Washington D.C.) is necessary.\nIn the State variable, ‘United States’ is included as a value, indicating that those rows represent national data, which lends to the US Crude Rate variable. This will be useful when comparing the regions to the national rates. Using the function: head(drug_mortality[, c(\"State\", \"Region\")]), I was able to authenticate the Region categorical variable has been created and is accurate.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Define the regions as vectors\nnortheast &lt;- c('Connecticut', 'Maine', 'Massachusetts', 'New Hampshire', 'New Jersey', 'New York', 'Pennsylvania', 'Rhode Island', 'Vermont')\nsouth &lt;- c('Alabama', 'Arkansas', 'Delaware', 'Florida', 'Georgia', 'Kentucky', 'Louisiana', 'Maryland', 'Mississippi', 'North Carolina', 'Oklahoma', 'South Carolina', 'Tennessee', 'Texas', 'Virginia', 'West Virginia', 'District of Columbia')  # Added D.C.to South region\nmidwest &lt;- c('Illinois', 'Indiana', 'Iowa', 'Kansas', 'Michigan', 'Minnesota', 'Missouri', 'Nebraska', 'North Dakota', 'Ohio', 'South Dakota', 'Wisconsin')\nwest &lt;- c('Alaska', 'Arizona', 'California', 'Colorado', 'Hawaii', 'Idaho', 'Montana', 'Nevada', 'New Mexico', 'Oregon', 'Utah', 'Washington', 'Wyoming')\n\n# Categorize states into regions\ndrug_mortality &lt;- drug_mortality %&gt;%\n  mutate(Region = case_when(\n    State %in% northeast ~ \"Northeast\",\n    State %in% south ~ \"South\",\n    State %in% midwest ~ \"Midwest\",\n    State %in% west ~ \"West\",\n    State == \"United States\" ~ \"National\",  # Handle \"United States\" separately\n    TRUE ~ \"Unknown\"  # For any unexpected or undefined states\n  ))\n\n# Convert Region to a factor (categorical variable)\ndrug_mortality$Region &lt;- factor(drug_mortality$Region, levels = c(\"Northeast\", \"South\", \"Midwest\", \"West\", \"National\"))"

When considering the research question of interest, the US region that has the greatest increase in drug poisoning mortality in comparison to all four US regions and the national average was the Northeast region, clearly visualized by the second line plot graphing “Average Drug Poisoning Death Rate by US Region (1999-2016)”.\nThe initial graph, showing the representative 5 states of each US region, allows the observers to gain an initial impression of the data. With this line graph “Average Drug Poisoning Death Rate by Representative State”, we notice that Illinois (representing the Midwest) and New York (representing the Northeast) have the steepest slopes in this initial line graph, inferring that these two regions these states represent may have the higher mortality rates than the other regions. When allowing more specificity by dividing all 50 states and the District of Columbia into the four US regions, we can properly assess the mortality rates of each region and can conclude that the Northeast region has had the greatest increase in mortality rates, as indicated by the steep slope of its line (large increase over smaller period of time) as well as the magnitude of the mean death rate value (nearing 40 deaths per 100,000 at the peak in the year 2016). When ranking the steepness of linear slopes of each region, the South has the second steepest slope, then the National mortality rate, then the Midwest, and finally the West. The West region is ranked last in this ranking, though in the graph it has the third highest mortality rate of about 17 deaths per 100,000 persons, its slope plateaus around the year 2011-2012, and steadily rises as seen in the faceted line plot.\nThe box plot presents similar information in a different format, where the Northeast, South, and Midwest have similar distributions with some higher outliers. The Midwest has the lowest mortality rates but increases over time. Yet, the West steadily increases and has less variability compared to the other categories. The West region has the lowest amount of outliers as well as a close-to-normal distribution in its box plot. The national distribution has the largest spread and the highest overall outliers, reflecting the extreme cases across the United States.\n\nPotential Factors Behind Observed Trends\nPublic health responses to the declaration of a national health emergency have affected populations, yet some regions of the United States may have more ease in accessing health care due to policies like increased regulation of opioid prescriptions, efforts to expand access to treatment for opioid use disorder, and the distribution of naloxone — a life-saving medication that can reverse opioid overdoses. This may explain the plateau of the West region’s drug poisoning mortality rates, while Northeast and South rates continued to skyrocket – as these regions are politically more diverse and unlikely to resolve policy easily. Despite these efforts, drug poisoning deaths have continued to rise in the last decade, exacerbated by the increasing presence of synthetic opioids like fentanyl noted as the “third wave” of the opioid epidemic.\n\n\nFurther Questions to Explore\nThe opioid crisis undoubtedly disproportionately affects certain demographics, with higher rates among middle-aged adults, non-Hispanic whites, and men. It would be worth exploring the correlation rates between these demographics, such as sex, Hispanic origin, and age, with the newfound knowledge gained from this data analysis of US regions and death mortality rates."

    "text": "The opioid crisis, declared a national health emergency in 2023, has been a public health issue since the late 1990s, when misleading assurances about the addictive nature of prescription opioids led to widespread over-prescribing. Over time, this crisis unfolded in three distinct waves: the initial rise in prescription opioid-related deaths (1999-2010), a surge in heroin use and overdose deaths after restrictions on prescription opioids (2010-2013), and the rapid increase in deaths from synthetic opioids like fentanyl, which are far more potent and lethal (2013-present)."

    "section": "Cleaning and Wrangling the Data",
    "text": "Cleaning and Wrangling the Data\n\nUnderstanding the NA Values\nIn cleaning the dataset, checking for NA values is an important step. Using the two functions: colSums(is.na(drug_mortality)), there is an equal amount of NA values across the variables named Age-adjusted Rate, Standard Error for Age-adjusted Rate, Lower Confidence Limit for Age-adjusted Rate, and Upper Confidence Limit for Age-adjusted Rate. The age-adjusted rates are missing for many entries, and the decision to filter them out or use an alternative rate (like crude rates) must be made.\nThis equal amount of 1728 NA values is due to how age-adjusted rates cannot be calculated without the known weight of each age group within a population each year. When assessing the dataset, the NA values only occur when matched with the national data (when the State variable value is equal to “United States”) as well as when the Age Group variable is a numbered age range other than the value “All Ages”. Because all of the NA values are related to the age-adjusted rates, this is not an issue for using the data. Deleting the data with NA values would be a mistake as it augments our understanding of the true data, and imputing the data to be the mode or mean of similar characteristics is not possible because it would not be accurate to what the variables measure.\nCrude death rates will be used instead when considering specific states and specific age ranges, gender, or ethnicity and when considering the national data, the variable US Crude Rates will be used.\n\n\nRemoving Irrelevant Variables\nNext in cleaning the data, I opted to remove two columns (variables) because they were not relevant to the data being analyzed. The Unit and State Crude Rate in Range variables will not be necessary in this project because of our intended research question and scope of our data analysis. The original dataset’s Unit variable has only one value of “per 100,000 population”. This does not fill any gaps of information that another variable cannot inform, and removing this variable is not a loss in the greater scope of the data. The variable State Crude Rate in Range is not relevant to the question of interest as we are considering regions in the United States instead of individual states as well as the comparison to the US Crude Rate, the State Crude Rate in Range variable is also repetitive and contains excess information.\nAfter cleaning the data and using the functions: str(drug_mortality[sapply(drug_mortality, is.character)]), six variables were loaded in as chr (character or text) variables: State, Sex, Age Group, Race and Hispanic Origin, State Crude Rate in Range, and Unit. The last two variables have been removed. Using the functions: str(drug_mortality[sapply(drug_mortality, is.double)]), 13 variables were loaded in as dbl (double or numeric with decimal) variables: Year, Deaths, Population, Crude Death Rate, Standard Error for Crude Rate, Lower Confidence Limit for Crude Rate, Upper Confidence Limit for Crude Rate, Age-adjusted Rate, Standard Error for Age-adjusted Rate, Lower Confidence Limit for Age-adjusted Rate, Upper Confidence Limit for Age-adjusted Rate, US Crude Rate, and US Age-adjusted Rate.\nSeeing that the Sex, Race and Hispanic Origin, and Age Group variables are character or text variables and have repeat values, I decided to create these variables as factors where repeated values are then organized into categories (i.e. Sex the values: “Both Sexes”, “Female”, and “Male”). This will make calling on these variables in the future easier, like in the instance of comparing drug mortality rates between the male and female sexes. Using the function: str(drug_mortality) , I was able to authenticate the conversion of variables to categorical variables where the variables values were listed by each unique value (i.e. the Sex variable should only have 3 values if done correctly).\nIn the case of the variable “Race and Hispanic Origin” (RHO), values like All Races - All Origins, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, and Hispanic were all present in this column. To combat the excess of wordings to get information about this variable, I opted to create a new categorical variable (new column) named Hispanic and assign values whether the individual is of Hispanic origin or not. When the RHO column indicated only the word “Hispanic” the value would be 1, while the value would be 0 if the RHO column indicated “Non-Hispanic” along with their race, or if it indicated “All Races - All Origins”.\n\n\nRepresentative States for U.S. Regions\nOur research question of interest asks what regions have had the greatest increase in drug poisoning mortality, I divided all 50 states (and the District of Columbia) into their respective US regions according the how the CDC defines the geographic regions in the United States. In order to gain a more comprehensive look at the data presented, and accurately create a visualization of the data, the use of all 50 states (and additional territory of the nation’s capital, Washington D.C.) is necessary.\nIn the State variable, “United States” is also included as a value which indicates that data of those rows are national data. This points to the US Crude Rates, which will be useful when comparing the regions to the national rates.\n#Add more\n\n\nTools Used for Data Exploration"
