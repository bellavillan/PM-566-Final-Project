The dataset, ‘Drug Overdose Death Rates by Drug Type, Sex, Age, Race, and Hispanic Origin in the United States (1999-2016),’ was obtained from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Drug-Poisoning-Mortality-by-State-United-Stat/xbxb-epbu/about_data) through their open-access online website.

The downloaded dataset is also available in the "Data" folder in this repository.
